In order to ensure backward compatibility we cannot go straight from non-strict to strict instead
we have to start by warning if strict was not set to true or false. The warning should indicate that a
future major release of pytest will change the default from False to True and recommend to use
strict=True as default and a plugin for actually flaky tests.
